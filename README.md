# [PLL Immaculate Grid]([https://patmc225.github.io/app/](https://premier-lacrosse-league.github.io/Immaculate-Grid/))
* I tried to create a PLL version of Sports Reference's Immaculate Grid game (https://www.immaculategrid.com/?utm_source=sr&utm_medium=sr_xsite&utm_campaign=2023_01_srnav).
* The categories on the left are always current PLL teams.
* The categories on the top randomly switch between colleges, MLL teams, countries, stats, positions, and more.
* A description of each category appears when you tap on it
* You get 9 guesses to fill out the grid.
* When you're out of guesses or you give up, you can see a list of every player that fills out each square.
* Every player's name leads to their page on the PLL website.
* I used the Retool player info table and downloaded season statistics to get all of the data.
